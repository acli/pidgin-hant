Updated translations for [Guifications](https://keep.imfreedom.org/grim/guifications2/).

When I did the original translations about 10 years ago I had only one monitor,
so I didn’t know how Guifications behaved on a dual-monitor system.

I’ve also made other corrections (e.g., I never tried using the theme editor) and minor improvements.
