Traditional Chinese translations for [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im)
================================================================

This is a copy of the traditional Chinese PO files for [pidgin](https://pidgin.im), release-2.x.y branch.
The Hong Kong Chinese translations are currently generated from the Taiwanese Chinese translations
with essentially the same script that was used way back in 2008.

The current project aims to resolve inconsistencies in the existing translation
and to finish it (a lot have been “translated” just by resurrecting translations that were present 10 years ago).
The file is currently 100% translated
but needs to go through copy and comparative editing.

Cantonese translation side project
----------------------------------

You can also find a script that will eventually be able to generate a Cantonese translation.
The script is currently half working but is really slow because of the amount of pseudo linguistic analysis needed.
